Overview
========

This is sample Rails application that demonstrates usage of

* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
* [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

This demo was used during [RailsWayCon 2011](http://railswaycon.com/2011/sessions#session-17838) conference presentation [Rails-like JavaScript using CoffeeScript, Backbone.js and Jasmine](http://www.slideshare.net/rsim/railslike-javascript-using-coffeescript-backbonejs-and-jasmine-8196890).

Source code is based on original [Todos application](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html) by [Jérôme Gravel-Niquet](https://github.com/jeromegn).
